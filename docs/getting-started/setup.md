# TODO

Modding necesse is not difficult to do, but you will need to set up a few things first:
- IDE (integrated development environment, or coding program)
- Gradle for the IDE
- wip





## IntelliJ


## VSCode

We recommend using IntelliJ, but if you prefer VSCode, it is a fairly simple process to make functional. VSCode can do everything required to create mods. There are a few quirks you will have to deal with and/or accept, but only one is a repeated issue (which we will get to).

1. Download and install VSCode
   - If you already have it, skip this step. If not, you can [download it here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
  
2. Download extensions
   - Find the `Extensions` button on the left sidebar, then search for `Gradle`, and install `Gradle for Java` by Microsoft.
   - Optionally but highly recommended, search `Java` and install the `Extension Pack for Java` (also by Microsoft) as those extensions could help you along with writing java.

3. Open the root folder of your mod in VSCode
   - The root folder contains the `build.gradle` and is required to run the tasks like buildModJar and runClient.
   - Only one mod may be opened in VSCode at a time, or gradle will throw errors.
