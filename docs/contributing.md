### Requesting Guides and reporting issues

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Guide Request

If the issue is that information in the guide is insufficient (or in the wrong place), make sure you provide us with that information in the request!

#### How Do I Submit a request or report?

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/Necesse-Community/unofficial-docs/issues/new).
- If requesting a new guide, properly explain the information you wish to see within the guide including...
    - Why you believe this guide is important
    - If information that would belong in this guide already exists elsewhere in an incomplete form
    - Any specifics you want to be included within the guide (I.E. how to make set armor) that we may otherwise forget. 
- If reporting an issue, properly explain the issue you have found, including...
    - What page and section its own
    - What the issue is

Once it's filed:

- Label the issue based on what you believe is correct. The options are `Invalid Information`, `Typo/Error` and `Request`

### Your First Contribution
> If you want to make smaller edits (Wiki style) you can find an `edit` button **on** the doc website at the top. Commiting fixes this way is a perfectly valid way of contributing smaller bits of information. 

It is recommended that you fork the repository. This is to help keep the main repo clean. 

Changes you make **do not** have to derive from an issue. In the event that your changes **do** derive from an issue, please properly link said issue in your Pull Request.
